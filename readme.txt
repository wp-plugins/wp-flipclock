Quickly and easily add a flipclock to your site’s posts and pages via a shortcode.

== Description ==

WP Flipclock is a plugin that allows you to quickly and easily add a flipclock to your site’s posts and pages via a shortcode.

The plugin allows you to count down or up from a specific date, as well as choose whether you count down days, hours or minutes.

To use the plugin in your site, all you need to add to the page is the `[flipclock]` shortcode. There are various attributes you can add as well:-

* **name** - Give the flipclock a name. Default is “flipclock”. If you have more than one flipclock on any page it’s useful to give them unique names.
* **countdown (True/False)** - Allows you to count down to a date (true), or count up from a date (false). Default is *false*.
* **date** – Any date string, formatted how you like, which the clock will count up from/down to. Default is *none*.
* **face (days/hours/minutes)** - The face of the clock. Default is hours. Options are:-

* days – Days : Hours : Minutes : Seconds
* hours - Hours : Minutes : Seconds
* minutes - Minutes : Seconds

This plugin uses the [Flipclock.js](http://www.flipclockjs.com) library from [ObjectiveHTML](https://www.objectivehtml.com/).
